# Reading Prep: Corpus
I believe that people attribute a bias to an artist that one could recognize.  If a poet made a spectacular poem and published it under his/her own name, the next time that same person publishes, the audience who attributed the original poem to that name, will be more inclined to find other work from the same author acceptable or biased to be good, like the first work one read from that author.  

How did the use of 'white' affect the context and popularity of Dickinsons poem?

As highlighted by the author, "We live in a world in which “data-driven” decisions are prioritized over anecdotal ones, and “evidence”".  I believe that we should perform data-driven decisions over anectodal ones.  Imagine if everyone thought that because of an anecdotal shark attack story once heard, one must not go into the open waters because of the fear of a shark attack, when in fact, less than four shark attacks per year occur worldwide.
