# Reading Prep: Chapter 3: 

#### Andrés Gorbea

## Questions or Observations

1. By looking exclusively at the title page of the book, one may overlook its history in regards to how the book has circulated from its conception to present day.  How have these details that have been glossed over have affected the credits, circulation, and impact of the book on society?


2. If Helvetica has more of an ‘worldwide appeal’, how has this font not diverged into the ‘academic feel’ that the Times font has been heavily associated?  


3. Some preachers persist through time because of the value of the message and not due to scribing.  For example, Martin Luther King Jr.  led the civil rights movement by preaching to audiences and inviting them to partake in the movement through speech. One does not need to become a scribe in order to make it one’s duty to accurately waken the consciousness of society.
