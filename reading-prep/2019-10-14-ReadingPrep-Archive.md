In the article _We're Taking the Genius of Sequoyah into This Century_, Cushman who cites Miller expresses 
> Its parts of speech reflect a people's unique way of categorizing phenomena.
In reference to the collectivist use of language in certain groups such as the Cherokee language, but how could a part of speech reflect a unique categorization phenomenon if each person categorizes ‘uniquely’ different?

I found interesting how the Cherokee’s shaped their vocabulary in order to reflect a specific meaning of the word, such as the use of the word persevere instead of a traditional meaning for preserve.  I believe it is important for minorities to represent their history onto their language because it embodies the culture.

How was categorization, organization, and effectivity affected by the introduction of alphabetic order in letters and words?
