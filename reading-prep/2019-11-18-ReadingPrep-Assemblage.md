2. Zines break the norm of using conventional structures for bodies of work in order to achieve an intimate experience with the author and the intended audience
3. According to Borsuk, changing the physicality of the codex changes the relation of the word to the world.  Why would a word need a physical context in order to evoke meaning? Why would a word lose its metaphoric value it holds if extracted from the physicality of a codex?
