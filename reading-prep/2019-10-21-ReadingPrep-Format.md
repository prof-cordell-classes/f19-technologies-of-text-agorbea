# Observations

#### Andres Gorbea

When the codex became an accessible, modern object, and personal object, people created situations, clubs, expressive spaces where they could share intellect in the same way an author does through a book.  Books have gained a new purpose in a new era, an object with social value.

Did the normalization of the codex as a personal item influence people to venture into the arts as a means of self-expression?

By conditioning of the mind to program it to read blocks on pages as one page one makes it extremely difficult to follow a different structure for a page, such as in Interleaf.  This conditoning might lead to the false conclusion that it is supposed to be one way or another, instead of recognizing that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior (ie. reading a block on a page instead of two pages for one)
