# Reading Prep: Chapter 8: Sensation

#### Andrés Gorbea

## Questions or Observations

If the universal approach for blind literacy is the ideal, why not adapt the Boston line type so that people with disadvantages read it more efficiently than braille, due to the fact that many sighted people don’t know how to read braille?

Why not adapt another language other than braille so that the blind can communicate in written form with sighted people?  For example, teach the Howe written language as well as braille, instead of prioritizing one? 

I believe that the human race will always choose the more ‘comfortable’ option.  However, I believe that the human race also cherishes and recognizes the power of books as those who have been educated have done so through many books.  I believe that people would fatigue themselves ceasing the hunger for curiosity of why and how the world works, preventing the extinction of books.
