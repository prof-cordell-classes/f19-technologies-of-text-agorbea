## Questions or Observations

William Blake integrated the most useful aspects of printmaking, bookmaking, illustrating, and the use of type in order to create unique and personalized versions of books he named “Illuminated books”.  He created his own shop where he incorporated the complete process of bookmaking, instead of separating the steps of bookmaking.

The notion expressed by Borsuk in his book _The Book_ that highlights the attractiveness of the object, the codex, as being taken for granted with the rise of the e-book can be misleading.  I believe this notion is oversimplified, leading the reader to believe that people only read books because they feel attracted to the codex, not the content of the book itself.  As an answer to that, I would say that people, for example, read self-help books solely for the content in the book, as they believe this content could better their lives.  

Why does the relationship between materiality and text become severed because of the e-book?  Many authors deny the possibility of having scribbles or drawings in their books, and if an author wants to include such, why not adapt the Kindle to fit the needs of the creators? I would include an option in Kindle where you could see the annotations or drawings the author wants the reader to experience while reading.
