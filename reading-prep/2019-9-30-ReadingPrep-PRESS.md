# Reading Prep: Chapter 4: Press

## Questions or Observations

I believe that everyone should be compensated financially for their work due to the quality and quantity of the work, not just women. If the printing press’ salary was based off the quality and quantity of work every individual does, the industry may have had achieved the best outcomes compared to how people were being secularized and discriminated by gender back then.

Why would people believe that the entrance of women in the workplace would affect the male’s salary? Women were introduced to the workplace with significant less pay and to this day still receive less monetary salary on average than a male counterpart.

Why is Amazon considered to be the sole first generation of commercial e-books? Amazon was a bookstore/e-book distributor but to assume that one couldn’t buy an e-book because of Amazon’s policies doesn’t mean one could not find different resources on the internet that can help download something which you can keep forever on your desktop.
