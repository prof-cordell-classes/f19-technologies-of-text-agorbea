# Lab Report: Letter Press 2: Presswork

#### Andres Gorbea

## Process Description

In this laboratory, a printing press was used to complete the laboratory from last week, where type was arranged in order to print one of the tweets sent out from the bot created for Twitter.  Once we arrived in the classroom, we were asked to finish up setting up the type on our composition box in order to print.  Once finished setting up the type on the box, the type was released from the compositor’s box onto a tray where quoins were used as block stoppers in order to set the type firmly in the tray.  Once the tray was fixed, quoins added, and the type was set, the tray was steadily carried from the table to the printing press.  Then, the black ink is distributed onto a round wooden platform that is distributed by cylindrical tubes that roll paint onto the type set on the tray below de round platform with the ink.  The lever on the left side of the printing press was pushed and released in order to get the tubes to distribute the ink on the type.  Once the ink was distributed, the press pushes the ink and type onto the paper and when released, the final product is achieved.  


## Observations

When I finished setting up the type in my compositor’s box, I transferred the type onto the tray.  Once the tray was set up within the correct margins for printing, the press was inked.  While the press was being inked, I thought to myself how arduous it must have been to work consistently with a viscous, gooey, black ink every day.  I wondered how many times the people that worked with ink stained their hands and clothes with it.  
While working with the printing press, I found the process to be extremely satisfying.  From the soothing sounds of the press to the flow of motion it powered by itself once given momentum.  I thought to myself how pleasing at the moment these sounds felt, but I pondered on how those sounds can become torturous after years of working with the printing press.  Each person was able to print seven copies of their poems and I was astounded on how beautiful the ink looks printed on paper.  The ink gave the paper new meaning and beautiful artistry.

## Analysis

Leah Price explains in her book _What We Talk About When We Talk About Books_, that as the book ages with time, it becomes a nostalgic object that becomes glamourous and untouchable.  Price goes on to even highlight a law made in France regarding books.
> European laws continue to single out books: France’s law against selling books below sticker price
By expressing the notion that countries have passed laws in order to ensure the livelihood of print, the codex appears to be an invaluable object.  I believe that since print and type revolutionized the message within the medium, books, as well as the printing press should be preserved.  If humanity cannot trace back one’s origins, one might lose the history that unites humans, which entails the type, print, history and evolution of the codex as it is the object that made communication in a plethora of methods possible.

Women were deemed unable to work a printing press.  The proponents for such preposterous idea would argue that women do not have a mechanical mind, to which the author argues:
> Either the female mind is mechanical, or that printing does not require a mechanical mind
This notion entails that printing does not require a mechanical mind, as the author is a proponent for women’s right to work in printing.  I believe that printing does require a mechanical mind, such that is skillful enough to understand the process of setting up type in a mirrored version, read from right to left.  This is no easy task, as one has to power against the mind as it has been conditioned to read/write the opposite way.
