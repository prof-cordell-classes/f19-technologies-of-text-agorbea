# Lab Report: MHS

#### Andres Gorbea

## Process Description

In this lab, we were asked to meet in the Massachusetts Historical Society, where we would learn about the archiving of literature and children’s literature, which was the subject picked by the professor for us to learn about.  After a short lecture about the uses of MHS and what we were going to do in that day, we were able to observe the children’s literature placed in front of us on a long conference table.  Books such as the origin story of Peter Pan, an old map of Boston, and books about how each gender should act were observed and read over.  Once we were able to freely observe the literature, we had a conversation amongst ourselves and the friendly educational tour guide about what we had read.

## Observations

When I first arrived to the MHS, I believed we were only going to learn about how the resources they had at hand were accessible to us.  To my surprise, when we went inside the conference room, there were about ten unknown (old) books placed on the table.  I glanced over a book that explained why any language other than English was the tongue and treason, to which I thought to myself: what kind of weird medieval racist Englishman are we going to learn about today? When the educational tour guide explained that what we were glancing over was children’s literature, I was even more concerned to as why was that on a children’s book.  After glancing over other books, such as, a book with images that filled in for words, the origin story of Peter Pan, how each gender should act, I realized, that this was the product of indoctrination.

Overall, what I expected of old children’s literature was consistent with what was actually in these books.  Indoctrination, conforming roles of society, pretty much anything that entails adults writing for children, with purpose.  Purpose could vary from entertainment to instilment of fear and societal systems that have prevailed, no in-between whatsoever.  A book could be mentioning the intricacies of the English language, then go on a rant about how the world is a better place with only native English speakers.  

## Analysis

One of the books presented in the MHS was a book about Native American language.  It was unable to be read because I do not know any Native American dialects, but professor Cordell explained to us that this book was one written by the Europeans in Native American lettering.  I believe that representation is important.  Native Americans created their own language as a means of comradery with each other.  Native American languages were also created as a response towards the injustice they have faced for centuries, in which this language was created in order for only Native Americans, so that they can understand each other in a unique language and for unity among them.

The author of this article, Ellen Cushman, highlights:
>Peoplehood and perseverance are sustained through Native languages in every body of work, casual conversation, or legal document that uses a tribal language

If Europeans are able to write in the Cherokee language, it defeats the purpose of the creation of such language.  Europeans of the time couldn’t even understand why it would defeat the purpose because the purpose was that they couldn’t understand it.  If the Europeans could understand the Native American language, then the Cherokee language should not exist, and the efforts of Sequoyah were for nothing.

In _Two Wordbooks_, Robert Cawdry explains the notion that
>Some men seek so far for outlandish English, that they forget altogether their mothers language, so that if some of their mothers were alive, they were not able to tell, or understand what they say

Which, I believe, was proven to be false in this laboratory.  As we saw, there have been books that use pictures to resemble words from the nineteenth century as well as in the twenty first century.  People communicate with icons, images, gestures, anything one may have at hand that helps with the expression of an idea.  This was exemplified in one of the children’s books presented in the MHS where drawings would resemble words.
