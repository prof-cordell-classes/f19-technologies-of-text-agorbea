# Lab Report: Book Binding

#### Andres Gorbea


## Process Description

In this lab experiment, the poems printed out from the twitter bots were bounded into books.  When we got to the classroom, there were a few instruments placed in front of each chair of the room.  In front of my chair, there was a ruler, three pages of paper, a device to puncture holes in the paper, a book cradle, and a bone cutter.  Using the bone cutter, we folded the papers in half.  Then, measurements for the holes that were used for binding were marked on the folded papers mounted on each other.  After marking positions at 1.25,2.75,4.25, and 5.75 centimeters, the device was used to puncture the markings on the papers at these positions.  After puncturing these holes, the binding process was shown to us, and the book of tweets sent out by our bots was able to be completed with waxy string used as the material for binding.


## Observations

When I arrived at the classroom, I was impressed with the number of tools set on the table. When professor Cordell explained that we would be learning about the binding process and binding a book of twitter bot poems, I believed I wouldn’t be able to do it.  I saw the drawings on the board, looked at the instruments in front of me and thought to myself: there is no way I will bind a book today successfully.  The drawings on the board, although clearly labeled, looked like a mess of loops and threading.

Although it appeared to be a strenuous task, with the help of professor Cordell it became a simple walkthrough of the steps.  When the time came to execute these steps in order to complete the binding, the hardest parts of book binding were the puncturing of holes in the middle of the crease and the binding itself.  


## Analysis

Before binding the codex of the twitter bot poems, one is able to examine the codex without being enclosed.  When looking at the bare pages, one is able to appreciate the art of binding.  I believed that the margins of the book would be too spacious, as that is the impression I felt when holding the pages in my hand.  Once I finished binding, I realized that the pages, margins, and letters were arranged perfectly beforehand.  In Leah Price’s _What We Talk About When We Talk About Books_, Price questions the use of individual pages for continuous reading instead of viewing the codex as an interleaf.  When faced with the bare pages of the twitter bot poems, I realized how unconventional it would be to read as interleaf.  The binding of the book causes the pages to, inevitably, curl into the enclosure.  

When reading in the form of the interleaf, the margins would have to be closely measured in order to make the experience of reading pleasurable and comfortable.  During the experiment, I thought to myself: if these pages were to be read as an interleaf, would I have been able to bind them correctly so that no words are omitted or ineligible due to the binding?  I quickly realized that this was the purpose of reading this excerpt from Price: pages are not supposed to be read as an interleaf because of the binding. It would be extremely uncomfortable to get used to reading into the curvature of the binding.

In terms of the art of binding, I was able to appreciate the process more due to the fact that I had to do it myself.  In _Baxter’s Procrustes_, the art of binding is exalted as an artform dear to the collector.  The author goes on to highlight:
> To the true collector, a book is a work of art, of which the contents are no more important than the words of an opera. Fine binding is a desideratum, and, for its cost, that of the Procrustes could not be improved upon. 

When I first read this, I believed that the notion of book binding as an art was considered by avid book collectors who were obsessed with the codex because they were wealthy enough to have access to them.  When finishing the codex of twitter bot poems, I realized how I held my product differently, as something I made with delicacy and dexterity.  To avid book collectors, unlike myself, this feeling would have been overwhelmingly exaggerated, due to the fact that these were their expressions of the art they cherished and practiced.
