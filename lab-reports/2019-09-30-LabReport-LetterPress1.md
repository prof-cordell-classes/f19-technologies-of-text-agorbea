# Lab Report: Letter Press 1: Composition

#### Andres Gorbea

## Process Description

In this laboratory, a California job case was used in order to create letterpress printed versions of one of the tweets sent out from the bot created in previous week’s lab, “Programming Literature”.  My bot was programmed to sample groups of words from the song “Lose Yourself” by Eminem.  A California job case is a wooden shelf used to store and organize movable type.  We used the California job case in order to use the type stored in the case. 

The type on the California job case was made out of lead, and the type, which was made of lead, was arranged in a wooden box separated by thin lines of lead between lines, and words were arranged from right to left, and read in mirror image.  I used a 24-point Melior Italic font and spelled out the first tweet my bot ever sent out, which was “his surface keeps whole but the bombs calm sweater looks nervous”.  The type was arranged on a 20-centimeter space, where after the last word of the 20 cm line, spacers were used on the left side in order to hold securely the type in the wooden box.  After completing the tweet, it was transferred to a printing press.


## Observations

When I arrived into the classroom, I felt I was the only one who had not worked with movable type.  I felt intimidated by the size of the California job case and believed I was going to be unable to finish the job in the remaining time period.  Luckily enough, the process was straightforward, the type was easy to use, find, and arrange on to the wooden box that measured the line to 20cm.  The type felt like lead, and as explained to us in class, it did stain my hands because of remainder ink left over on the press.  

I believed the process felt like a rather calming experience, taking the time to simulate a tweet that could be sent out in a second, while it took me almost an hour to organize the letters and spacers.  It felt like I was paying tribute to the process of bookmaking and the history of the language.  I also understood how this job could become very tedious to take for a long term of time.  I wondered during the lab if people would rather prefer to speak their thoughts to close ones instead of going through the process of organizing arduous, difficult type then going through the process of the printing press.  


## Analysis

According to the video named _The Machine That Made Us_, the printing press was established to be for the talented and skilled in the field of composition.  This notion was proved to be true in the lab performed, as I didn’t believe I would even be able to correctly print an 80-character tweet, I couldn’t believe how these people were able to work long hours with different sizes and fonts.  The process of producing type up until the final product of the print was explained in this video, which makes it remarkable to ponder on how hard it must have been to create the type before even using the press or even before they had California job cases.  The work of someone who used the printing press was extremely respected after trying to emulate.

According to Trithemius in the excerpt from _In Praise of Scribes_, he expresses the notion that
> The scribe, distinguished by piety, is the herald of God, because he announces His will to present and future peoples, promising eternal life to the good, pardon to the penitent, penalty to the negligent, and damnation to the contemptible.

If following the notion that a scribe is the herald of God because of the intricacies of his work, then the person who works with type and a printing press can also be considered a herald of God.  A person who works with type can be considered a herald of God because if that person doesn’t correctly use the type or the printing press, the word of God may be misinterpreted by the lack of correct use of type or print, condemning the person who worked with the printing press as well as a scribe who misrepresents a translation.

In the same excerpt, a different argument is brought up from Trithemius, who expresses on his behalf:
> Greater is the piety of the scribe than that of the preacher; the preacher's warning perishes with time, but the scribe's pronouncements will last for many years.

If the word of God is misrepresented through translation, or writing, wouldn’t it have the same effect?  Wouldn’t the person who speaks and fails to communicate the word of God have the same punishment as the scribe? What about in the future, does the person working with a printing press under even more scrutiny than a scribe due to the fact that the printing press would last longer than a scribe’s work?  Why does the punishment for blasphemy of the word of God would change according to what medium it is expressed in?
