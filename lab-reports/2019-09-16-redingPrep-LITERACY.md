## Questions or Observations

1. In Amaranth Borsuk’s _The Book_, the author refers to the book’s development in society was driven by “the ever-increasing informational needs of society”.  I do not believe that there has been an increase in informational needs.  I believe that society as whole has intellectually evolved in regard to the way in which we effectively archive information and that society has become aware of the fact that the information we know is the basis of civilization: hence, the effort in writing and storing information.

2. A medium is the message in the same way that context adjusts the meaning of what is said.  Context, in this case, is the medium because the medium can shape the meaning of a message.  By adding context to a message, one is able to decipher its meaning, as well as if one understands the context of the medium, one may understand what is said in the message and what is appropriate according to the medium used.

3. By translating passages from Latin to the English language, one may cause a discrepancy between the message that the author is trying to express and the message that is understood by the reader.  The author emphasizes how translating foreign documents is an irresponsible act committed by the translator because it may propagate these discrepancies observed in the translation of an alien language.
