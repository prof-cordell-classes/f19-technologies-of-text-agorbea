# Lab Report: Text as Data

#### Andres Gorbea

## Process Description

In this laboratory, R programming was used in order to introduce coding as a useful tool for language studies.  We began by accessing the URL made available by Professor Cordell, where once accessed, the settings of the code and aesthetic were adjusted to fit one’s own preference.  After adjusting the settings, a long set of code was sitting on the screen.  As explained by Professor Cordell, we were to learn about the conventions of the code in order to have the skills to reproduce the code ourselves.  By learning the conventions of the code, we were able to learn about variables, how arrows can indicate how groups of information can be placed in such variables and could also be arranged in a specific notation or order so that the code can be read efficiently, we learned about tokens and what they entail as a unit of language.  After learning about the code, we were to run the code on our screens in order to learn about the functions.  By the use of variables and tokens, we were able to group information about authors, make graphs of statistics of their work, and even group the most frequently used words in their work, and using code, we were able to modify the results so that we can learn the pertinent information.  


## Observations

Once I accessed the link on my computer, I already felt overwhelmed with the amount of code that in my screen.  None of the code looked recognizable, not even legible! Asa person who has the least experience with code, this felt like it would be a challenge and a half.  Nonetheless, I tried to attentively follow Professor Cordell’s instructions and ended up learning a plethora of information of code.  One of the most important aspects of the code I learned was the notation, such as arrows, how an arrow can pack information from a source, group, place, and insert it into a variable, which can be used as a folder or a tab on a computer.  I also learned about a pipe, which can resemble the order of operations in which the code proceeds and looks like: %>%.  


One of the biggest takeaways from this lab was realizing that all of the code in the program was legible.  At first, when I looked at the code by itself without knowing what it meant, I believed I needed computer science courses in order to understand what the code entailed with its symbols, but Professor Cordell made sure to make us realize that all of the code in this program was completely legible, and that we just had to understand what these words meant so that we can be able to read the code.  Words such as variables, tokens, unnest, pipe, word sort, count, group, and ungroup were words that if one understood their meaning in this context, it paves the way for one to be able to read the code.

## Analysis

Coding is considered science, language of programming, the instructions manual for a bot.  These are real implications of using code, but programming can also be used for the study of language, frequency, and could even provide sociocultural context.  For example, in this lab, we used the code written by Professor Cordell in order to run it, and adjust so we can achieve results.  By the use of variables, we were able to arrange code in such a way where when the variable tab was accessed, the most common words used in the novel _Jane Eyre_ were arranged by frequency of use.  By the use of code, one can also understand sociocultural context, due to the fact that if one is observing which words were most commonly used in novels of a certain time, one can comprehend what kind of vocabulary was used in novels, as well as general society.  One could also understand the effects of such novels in future works, as one could potentially code so that the influence of words used in a novel, such as _Jane Eyre_, affected future vocabulary use in later works of the 19th century.  

As Ada Lovelace understood, the analytic engine had more potential than the sole use of calculations for the engine.  I believe there is an interesting comparison with the analytical machine and programming, as both of them are looked as calculators, in the way that an analytical machine can solve calculations and programming is the art of coding instructions in order to complete tasks.  In the same way, I believe that culturally we are at the same standpoint where Ada Lovelace was, in the way that not many people converse about the implications of coding beyond solving calculations or instructions, as coding can be an efficient method to studying language or culture.  I believe that if people understood the implications of coding outside of the preconceived notions, programming can fulfill its great potential as a facilitator to group large groups of information and arranging in order to make it legible and understandable for the reader.
