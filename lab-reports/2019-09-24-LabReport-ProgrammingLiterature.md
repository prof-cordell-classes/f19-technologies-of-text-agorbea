# Lab Report: Programming Literature

#### Andres Gorbea


## Process Description
In this lab experiment, twitter bots were created using JavaScript Object Notation.  In order to create this bot, we worked with JSON, got familiar with the notation and the code, and grouped words according to their classification.  I utilized the song Lose Yourself by Eminem and classified each word of the first few lines of the song according to its group.  Words from the first few lines were identified and grouped as nouns, adjectives, determiners, verbs, adverbs, pronouns, and prepositions.  By using adequate code to group these words correctly, then writing an “origin” sentence which would organize the sentence into the correct order of groups according to the first line of the song.  Using this origin sentence, the groups summon a word from the list of words classified in that group and randomize the structure of the sentence following the first sequence of the song.  The code was connected to a bot programmed to tweet every day twice.  The account linked with the bot was created prior to the lab.


## Observations
I had never worked with JSON before.  I had previously used java script language to code but years prior to the current year.  I was afraid of not understanding how the code worked or being able to even program the bot in order for it to be able to tweet, but it came as a surprise how straightforward the process was.  

The notation used for the code was very confusing.  The instructions were specific and if not followed perfectly, none of the code would work.  The code had to be in the complete notation for it to work, which is why it took me a while to finalize the process.  While working on this lab, I wondered to myself how people get used to writing in such a manner and be able to program exponentially more elaborate bots that incorporate higher levels of functioning.


## Analysis
The notion expressed by Annette Vee in her book, _Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming Is Changing Writing_, the author expresses the notion that everyone should learn how to code.  However, I believe otherwise, as this experiment proved my misconception to be true.  I have never needed to code until my third year of college in which I decided to take this class.  Even though one may argue that times are changing and so should we, it seems a preposterous idea to assume that everyone should learn the mechanics of coding as I did for this lab.

>To lack the knowledge of something popularly considered literacy is to be illiterate.

Coding is a skill, as observed in this lab, some students were quick to finish the code for the bot others, like me, were not. Whether I can finish the code or not, or even know how to, will not (hopefully) be a determiner in myself becoming illiterate.  Code is a skill, a way of writing.  It is also a skill to know and master the Spanish language yet knowing Spanish or not will not determine my literacy.  Code is not a language, yet a skill, therefore I cannot become illiterate if I don’t know a specific manner of writing.

The work of translation is dangerous in the hands of the scribe.  As mentioned by Brandon Hawk in the article _ÆLFRIC’S PREFACE TO GENESIS: A TRANSLATION_, 
> the work [of translation] is very dangerous to me or anyone to undertake

The same notion could be applied to one who writes code and translates the English language into the language of code, in this case, JavaScript Object Notation.  It is still dangerous to think that someone may program a bot to incorrectly check spelling on other Twitter accounts.  Not only is this person believing that the interaction is with another human, but the information this bot is feeding people is false.  This goes hand in hand with the notion of the fear of one who thinks that there is no difference between the new law and old.  In this case, the law would symbolize the interaction produced online, and the fear of people believing that they are interacting with a human, and on top of that, an incorrect correction of spelling.  This would be the modern example of translating loosely the words of Latin to English.  The fear is still prevalent, yet has taken a different form, in this case, robots versus humans.
