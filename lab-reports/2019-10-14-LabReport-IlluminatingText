# Lab Report: Illuminating the Text

#### Andres Gorbea

## Process Description
When I arrived at the classroom, I noticed that everything was dark.  Few candles were lit up with two papers beside it: one was blank, the other was a handwritten (copy) of a letter.  I sat in a random chair, where the letter in front of me was written by Edgar Allan Poe.  I begin to copy the letter on the blank piece of paper given to me until around twenty-five minutes pass.  Once the time was up, the classroom was lit up once again with lightbulbs, the candles were blown out, and the fire department of Northeastern made sure we were safe.  Then, once the activity was over, we looked at a geography book which had no illustrations.

## Observations
Once I was in the classroom, I thought we were going to do exactly what we did.  I believed we were going to prove how hard physically and emotionally was to copy a text in a time where technology was very limited compared to now.  I believed beforehand that the visibility would be dim and that the task would be exponentially harder with the absence of lightbulbs.  I thought to myself how people back then didn’t use pencils, and how the use of a different instrument instead of the pencil would make the task incredibly arduous.
The classroom was lit up by several candles, which also made me ponder on how different the task would be if many of us would have to share the same light.  I wondered how all of these advantages that we have now could benefit their use and maximize their productivity.  Once the activity was over, the geography book next to the candle was observed and I couldn’t imagine how someone could make a visual map out of directions and localizations through explanations of words, not the use of maps.

## Analysis
William Blake pioneered the technique of illuminated printing.  Blake did not have the privilege that modern generations do of being able to use artificial light.  Blake experienced the same conditions of light that we used in this lab, which brings up many questions, as to how Blake used his workshop in regard to visibility, was the printing and illustrating process ever affected by the absence of light? How was the etching process performed under these conditions?  How were they able to handle corrosive acids and chemicals with no protection or visibility?  
In Amaranth Borsuk’s book, _The Book_, the notion of revolutionizing the relationship between the reader and print is brought up.  Borsuk mentions Blake as the pioneer who revolutionized print by introducing visual art in the works of the time.  Referring back to the lab experiment, where no images or illustrations were to be seen on the geography books, the relationship between the reader and the print was changed once the incorporation of illuminated books became normal.  By such a change in the manner for which how and why we handle, store, read and use books, humans were finally able to connect with the book as an object instead of a soliloquy translated to writing.  
In fact, Stéphane Mallarmé expands on the idea of the changing nature of the book once art and illumination were introduced in the codex.  He goes on to express,
>the page is not a vessel, but an ocean; and the text, tossed on its waves, is a shipwreck in language that draws the reader’s eye across its shimmering surface
This quote by Mallarmé in _The Book_ supports the notion of how the codex was viewed by the people of that time.  People began to view the book as an idea, as a powerful medium that could be used to express anything capable of being expressed.
